In this blog I will explore cool technologies by doing some experiments on computer systems, small and large, and writing code. In most cases source code will be provided in the repository: surfsnippets. I don’t like to read long posts so I will write just enough to describe the experiment. I follow the principle: “The harder to write, the harder to read”.
